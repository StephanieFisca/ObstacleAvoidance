# ObstacleAvoidance
This is an Android Studio Project coded in the Java programming language, made to be run as a mobile application. 
It is a remake of a classic avoidance game, where the main player is a ghost that must avoid the falling bombs from the top of the screen. As time passes in the game, the number of points accumulated will increment,
and the game will stop once the ghost has been hit 3 times by the bombs. The high score will be memorised, and can be overwritten with each gameplay if the current score surpasses the current high score.
Please enjoy!
